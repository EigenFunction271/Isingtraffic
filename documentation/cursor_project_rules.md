# Cursor Project Rules

### 1. File Organization
- All core code lives in the project root (or `src/` if expanding).
- Docs and planning files go into `/docs`.

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Variables follow `snake_case`
- Classes use `PascalCase`
- Streamlit UI elements prefixed with `st_` or clearly named by function.

### 3. Code Comments
- Use triple quotes for class/method docstrings
- Use inline comments sparingly and only for non-obvious logic

### 4. Version Control
- Commit one meaningful feature or fix at a time
- Use semantic commit messages (e.g. `feat: add energy plot`, `fix: correct closure parser`)

### 5. Task Management
- Use TODO comments with your initials if shared (`# TODO [AA]: Improve closure UX`)
- Track future upgrades in `implementation_plan.md`
